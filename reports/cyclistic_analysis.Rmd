Executive Summary
Short summary of findings (fill in after running).
Key metrics: total rides, average ride length, difference between members & casuals, busiest weekday/hour.

Data ingestion & cleaning
Explain steps: detection of start/end columns, conversion to datetime, removal of negative/zero rides, NA handling.

Exploratory analysis
Rides by user type
user_col <- intersect(c("member_casual","user_type","usertype","member_type"), names(data))[1]
by_type <- data %>% group_by(.data[[user_col]]) %>%
  summarise(total_rides = n(), avg_duration = mean(ride_length_min)) %>% arrange(desc(total_rides))
knitr::kable(by_type)

Visuals
rides_day <- data %>% group_by(.data[[user_col]], day_of_week) %>% summarise(number_of_rides = n(), avg_ride_length = mean(ride_length_min))
ggplot(rides_day, aes(x = day_of_week, y = number_of_rides, fill = .data[[user_col]])) + 
  geom_col(position="dodge") + 
  labs(title = "Number of Rides by Day of Week & Rider Type", x = "Day", y = "Number of Rides", fill = "User Type") +
  theme_minimal()

Conclusions & Recommendations
Provide 3â€“4 actionable recommendations for Cyclistic marketing/product team (e.g., target casual riders on weekends with promotions; encourage membership conversions, etc.)
